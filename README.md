# FGO-servant-Java
A Java app to search some information on the game Fate/Grand Order

## Description of the project

The project will be divided in 2 category.

- Mobile.
- JavaFX.

This project is mainly used to help me train my skills in this 2 Java category.

### Mobile

The project is built around Java 10, being usable on around 50% of the Android device.

The data used are from the API atlasacademy, and the Volley library will be used.

For the moment, only some information on the servants are planned, other information might be added in the future.

### JavaFX

For the moment, nothing has been written, I still need to learn JavaFX.

It will mainly be used for me to learn the difference between JavaFX and Swing, which I've already used at the IUT for different Java project.
